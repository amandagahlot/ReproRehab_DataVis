# Introduction


Effective data visualization is key to enhancing transparency, improving readability, and facilitating knowledge sharing. This presentation will guide you through workflows and coding strategies in R that simplify these processes while maximizing clarity and impact. By the end, you'll have a set of practical "cheat codes" to streamline your workflow and elevate your visualizations to publication-ready standards.

Overview of Topics

We'll cover the following key areas:

**Set-Up in R Markdown**: Learn best practices for structuring R Markdown files to enhance readability, improve workflow efficiency, and seamlessly integrate text, code, and output.

**Creating and Formatting Tables** Discover strategies for generating clean, organized tables that are easily exported to Word documents for further editing and refinement.

**Correlation Plots** Explore methods for visualizing variable relationships using correlation matrices and heatmaps to reveal key patterns in your data.

**Interactive Visualizations** Discover dynamic plotting techniques that engage viewers and allow for deeper data exploration.

**Sharing Visualizations Across Platforms** Master the process of sharing your visualizations via multiple platforms, including GitHub, PowerPoint, and HTML files, ensuring your work is accessible and impactful.

This structured approach will equip you with reusable tools to make your work more efficient, transparent, and visually compelling.

# Set Up 

## Project

For each new project, it's best to create a dedicated environment and project in R Studio. This approach helps to:

-- Keep your files organized and isolated from other projects

-- Manage dependencies effectively

-- Improve reproducibility by ensuring your code runs consistently in the same environment

As Stephen Covey famously said, *"Begin with the end in mind."* This mindset is key to ensuring your research is reproducible. Knowing I'll eventually share my visualizations and use GitHub for version control, I set up my project like this:

1. Start new repository in GitHub: For this one, I'm calling it ReproRehab_DataVis

2. Start new project in R Studio (File -> New Project -> Version Control) and link it to the new repository. I am calling this project "DataVis_Project" *if you haven't linked your R Studio with your GitHub, you'll need to do that first*

It's that simple. Now when you're done with your script, you can push directly to your GitHub repository.


## R Notebook

In your new environment, go to File -> New File -> R Notebook.

R Notebooks offer a clean, streamlined way to combine code, output, and narrative in one document. This makes them ideal for sharing visualizations and insights without overwhelming readers with excess code.

By including this setup chunk, you can control how code and output appear, ensuring your document stays clear and focused. This is especially useful when presenting results to audiences who may not be familiar with R.

#### Chunks

A chunk in R Notebook is a block of code enclosed in triple backticks ( ```{} `). The content inside runs like regular R code.

You can customize how chunks appear in the final knitted document using options inside the curly braces {}. 

These options help control what your audience sees, keeping your document clean and focused.

The code below ensures that, unless otherwise specified in a specific chunk of code, all chunks will read as such.

```{r prelims, echo=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'asis')
#
```

Now all of my chunks of code below will be included in my knitted, final document, but any messages or warnings will not. If you want to exclude your code, you can set as include=FALSE. 

For data visualization, make sure you have:

*results = 'asis'*

This ensures that outputs like tables or text appear as intended without additional formatting applied by R Markdown.

## Set Working Directory

When working with visualizations, it’s important to start by setting your working directory. This practice ensures that all saved outputs—such as tables, images (.png), and knitted HTML files—are organized within one folder. This structure simplifies the process of sharing your visualizations by allowing you to easily upload the entire folder to GitHub or other platforms.

When you initiated your new Project in R Studio, it should have created a folder on your hard drive. For simplicity, use that folder as your working directory. For me that is:
Macintosh HD > Users > amandagahlot > DataVis_Project

```{r set wd}
setwd("/Users/amandagahlot/DataVis_Project") #replace your pathname here
```

Basic packages to load:

```{r packages to start}
library(tidyverse)
library(psych)
library(data.table)
library(sjPlot) 
library(sjmisc) 
library(sjlabelled) 
library(gtsummary)
library(readxl)

```
Then import your data set

```{r import data}
df <- read_excel('synthetic_data.xlsx') #no need for pathname because we've set up our working directory

```
# Tables

Creating tables in R and saving as word docs decreasing the risk of transposing numbers incorrectly and ultimately saves time. Below, I use the gt and gtsummary packages to create tables. You can use these as templates for your own work!

## Renaming variables

The variable name 'acsg_curr' may be clear to you, but it may confuse others who are unfamiliar with its meaning. Renaming your variables to more descriptive labels can improve clarity, making your data visualizations and results easier for others to understand and interpret.

I recommend keeping one version of your dataset unchanged for your core analysis. This ensures your original variable names, which may be essential for loops or other coding processes, remain intact. Then, import your data again under a different dataframe name specifically for relabeling variables to enhance readability in visualizations and reports.


```{r rename}
df_demo <- df #df_demo will be what I use for tables
```

And then rename categorical data 

```{r categorical}
df_demo$gender <- factor(df_demo$gender,
                   levels = c(1,2,3),
                   labels = c("Male", "Female", "Nonbinary"))

df_demo$work_current <- factor(df_demo$work_current,
                   levels = c(1,0),
                   labels = c("Yes", "No"))

df_demo$severity <- factor(df_demo$severity,
                   levels = c(2,3),
                   labels = c("Moderate", "Severe"))

df_demo$mech_injury <- factor(df_demo$mech_injury,
                   levels = c(1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = c("Fall", "MVC", "Sports", "Violence", "Pedestrian struck"))

df_demo$income <- factor(df_demo$income,
                   levels = c(1,2,3),
                   labels = c("<52K", "52K-156K", ">156K"))

df_demo$marital_status <- factor(df_demo$marital_status,
                                 levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                                 labels = c("Single", "Married", "Divorced", "Widowed"))
```

Now I have two data frames, the original "df" which is still numeric and df_demo which is character. I will use the df_demo for tables

Finally, I rename the variables with more meaningful names. Depending on your workflow, you can keep this with df_demo or create a third dataframe for visualizations, which I have done below:


## Descriptives
When providing descriptive statistics on your participants:

```{r packages for tables}
#install.packages(gt)
#install.packages(dplyr)
library(gt)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r summary}
summary_table <- df_demo %>%
  select(age_current, gender, race, income, marital_status, 
         phys_health_index, emo_health_index, 
         tbiqol_genconcern_tscore, spstotal, 
         frsbe_exec, frsbe_disinhib, frsbe_apathy, frsbe_total) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    missing = "no",
    type = list(
      all_continuous() ~ "continuous",
      all_categorical() ~ "categorical"
    ),
    statistic = list(
      all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})", #can include other descriptives here
      all_categorical() ~ "{n} ({p}%)"
    ),
    digits = list(all_continuous() ~2), #rounds everything 2 decimal places
    label = list(
      age_current ~ "Age",
      gender ~ "Gender",
      race ~ "Race",
      income ~ "Annual household income",
      marital_status ~ "Marital status",
      phys_health_index ~ "Physical Health Index",
      emo_health_index ~ "Emotional Health Index",
      tbiqol_genconcern_tscore ~ "General Cognition",
      spstotal ~ "Social Support",
      frsbe_exec ~ "Executive Function",
      frsbe_disinhib ~ "Disinhibition",
      frsbe_apathy ~ "Apathy",
      frsbe_total ~ "Total Score"
    )
  ) %>%
  modify_header(label ~ "**Variable**") %>%
  modify_spanning_header(everything() ~ "**Participant Characteristics**") %>%
  as_gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.names = "Times New Roman")

print(summary_table)

```
Then you can save your final table with the following code.

**PRO TIP** 

*Save your tables and visualizations in a separate code chunk as it sometimes breaks or doesn't work properly. It also allows you to tweak your code without saving it if you don't want to*

```{r}
#to save table to word doc
library(gt)
#install(gtsummary)
library(gtsummary)

gtsave(summary_table, filename = "summary_charac_table_1.docx")

```

This table is now found in my working directory as a word doc for easy formatting for manuscript preparation.

## Comparison 

You can use the same code, but add the "by" argument to compare results between 2 or more groups. In the example below, I want to compare the difference in characteristics by severity of injury (moderate versus severe). I've included a p value for any statistically significant differences in the groups. 

```{r compare}
by_table <- df_demo %>%
  subset(., select = c(age_current, time_injury, gender, edu, race, work_current, income, house_size, marital_status, substance, mech_injury, severity)) %>%
  tbl_summary(
    missing = "no",
    by = severity,
    type = list(
      c(age_current, edu, house_size, substance, time_injury) ~ "continuous",
      c(gender, income, work_current, mech_injury) ~ "categorical"
    ),
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})", all_categorical() ~ "{n} ({p}%)"),
    label = list(
      age_current ~ "Age (years)",
      time_injury ~ "Time since TBI (years)",
      gender ~ "Gender",
      race ~ "Race/Ethnicity",
      edu ~ "Education (years)",
      work_current ~ "Employment status",
      income ~ "Annual household income",
      house_size ~ "Size household",
      marital_status ~ "Marital status",
      substance ~ "Substance use score",
      mech_injury ~ "Cause of injury"
    )
  ) %>%
  add_p(
    test = list(all_continuous() ~ "t.test", all_categorical() ~ "chisq.test"),
    pvalue_fun = ~style_pvalue(.x, digits = 2)
  ) %>%
  add_n()

print(by_table)   
```
And can again save to my working directory

```{r save table 2}
by_table %>% 
  as_gt() %>% #in this example, my table was a tbl_summary object, not a gt object. To save a tbl_summary as a .docx file, you need to first convert it to a gt object using as_gt()
  gtsave(filename = "by_table.docx")

```


# Corrplots

When exploring data, it's common to use corrplots to visualize relationships between all variables. However, when dealing with a large number of variables, this can become overwhelming and less informative. To address this, I will explore two approaches:

**Interactive Corrplot**: This allows you to hover over the plot to see details about the variables, making it easier to explore large datasets.

**Specific, Publish-Ready Correlation Plot**: A more focused and polished correlation plot, designed for use in publications.

## Interactive Corrplot


```{r corrplot}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(Hmisc)
library(plotly)

# Calculate the correlation matrix
all_variables <- c("age_current", "time_injury", "gender", "edu", "work_current", "income", "severity", "substance", "acsg_prev", "acsg_curr", "acsg_retain", "acsi_prev", "acsi_curr", "acsi_retain", "acsl_prev", "acsl_curr", "acsl_retain", "acsf_prev", "acsf_curr", "acsf_retain", "acss_prev", "acss_curr", "acss_retain","tbiqol_part_sra_tscore", "tbiqol_anxiety_tscore", "tbiqol_comm_tscore", "tbiqol_ue_tscore","tbiqol_depression_tscore", "tbiqol_fatigue_tscore", "tbiqol_genconcern_tscore", "tbiqol_grief_tscore", "tbiqol_mobility_tscore", "tbiqol_headache_tscore", "tbiqol_pain_tscore", "tbiqol_posaffect_tscore", "tbiqol_resilience_tscore", "tbiqol_satissra_tscore", "tbiqol_selfesteem_tscore", "tbiqol_stigma_tscore", "spstotal", "bfi_extraversion", "bfi_agreeable", "bfi_consciousness", "bfi_neuroticism", "bfi_openness", "frsbe_apathy", "frsbe_exec", "frsbe_disinhib", "frsbe_total")

all_variables <- intersect(all_variables, colnames(df))  # Ensure selected variables are in the dataframe

all_variables_df <- df[, all_variables]

# Compute correlation matrix and p-values
cor_matrix <- rcorr(as.matrix(all_variables_df), type = "pearson")$r
cor_matrix[upper.tri(cor_matrix)] <- NA
p_matrix <- rcorr(as.matrix(all_variables_df), type = "pearson")$P
p_matrix[is.na(p_matrix)] = .0000001
p_matrix[upper.tri(p_matrix)] <- NA

# Melt the matrices for ggplot
melted_cor <- melt(cor_matrix, na.rm = T)
melted_p = melt(p_matrix, na.rm = T)

# Combine correlation and p-value information
melted_cor$p = melted_p$value
melted_cor$psig = ""
melted_cor$psig[melted_cor$p < .05] = "*"
melted_cor$psig[melted_cor$p < .01] = "**"
melted_cor$psig[melted_cor$p < .001] = "***"
melted_cor$hover_text = paste0("Variable 1: ", melted_cor$Var1, 
                               "<br>Variable 2: ", melted_cor$Var2, 
                               "<br>Correlation: ", round(melted_cor$value, 2), 
                               "<br>P-value: ", round(melted_cor$p, 4))

# Create a ggplot heatmap without text labels
all_corr <- ggplot(melted_cor, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value, text = hover_text)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "purple", mid = "white", high = "orange", 
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), space = "Lab",
                       name = "Correlation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Remove x axis labels
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),  # Remove y axis labels
        axis.title = element_blank(),  # Remove axis titles
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +  # Remove axis ticks
  labs(caption = "<.05 = *, <.01 = **, <.001 = ***") +
  ggtitle("Correlation Matrix all variables")

# Convert the ggplot to an interactive plotly plot
interactive_corr <- ggplotly(all_corr, tooltip = "text")

# Show the interactive plot
interactive_corr

```

This is a great option to explore your data and see some stronger and weaker relationships. But it's not all that understandable to someone who doesn't know what your variable labels mean. 

So we can rewrite our labels to make it easier to understand:

```{r renaming variables}
df2<- df #df2 is what I'll use for visualizations
df2 <- df2 %>%
  rename(Global = acsg_retain,
         IADL = acsi_retain,
         Leisure = acsl_retain,
         Fitness = acsf_retain,
         Social = acss_retain,
         Extraversion = bfi_extraversion,
         Agreeable = bfi_agreeable,
         Consciousness =bfi_consciousness,
         Neuroticism = bfi_neuroticism,
         Openness = bfi_openness,
         Apathy = frsbe_apathy,
         ExecFunc = frsbe_exec,
         Disinhibition = frsbe_disinhib,
         Total = frsbe_total,
         SocialSupport = spstotal,
         Communication = tbiqol_comm_tscore,
         ExecFuncQOL = tbiqol_execfunc_tscore, 
         GeneralCognition = tbiqol_genconcern_tscore,
         UpperExtremity = tbiqol_ue_tscore, 
         Fatigue = tbiqol_fatigue_tscore, 
         Mobility = tbiqol_mobility_tscore, 
         Headache = tbiqol_headache_tscore,
         Pain = tbiqol_pain_tscore,
         Anger = tbiqol_anger_tscore,
         PositiveAffect = tbiqol_posaffect_tscore,
         Age = age_current,
         Education = edu,
         Work = work_current,
         SubstanceUse = substance,
         Anxiety = tbiqol_anxiety_tscore, 
         Depression = tbiqol_depression_tscore, 
         Grief = tbiqol_grief_tscore, 
         TraitResilience = tbiqol_resilience_tscore,  
         SelfEsteem = tbiqol_selfesteem_tscore, 
         Stigma = tbiqol_stigma_tscore,
         TimeSinceInjury = time_injury,
         MaritalStatus = marital_status,
         SocialSupport = spstotal,
         HouseholdSize = house_size,
         PhysicalHealth = phys_health_index,
         EmotionalHealth = emo_health_index)
         
```

Now when we run the same code, it's a little easier to understand what we're looking at:

```{r relabeled corrplot}
all_variables <- c('Global','IADL','Leisure','Fitness','Social','Extraversion','Agreeable','Consciousness','Neuroticism','Openness','Apathy','ExecFunc','Disinhibition','Total','SocialSupport','Communication','ExecFuncQOL', 'GeneralCognition', 'UpperExtremity', 'Fatigue', 'Mobility', 'Headache','Pain', 'Anger','PositiveAffect','Age','Education','Work','SubstanceUse','Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Grief', 'TraitResilience',  'SelfEsteem', 'Stigma','TimeSinceInjury','MaritalStatus','SocialSupport','HouseholdSize','PhysicalHealth', 'EmotionalHealth')

all_variables <- intersect(all_variables, colnames(df2))  # Ensure selected variables are in the dataframe

all_variables_df2 <- df2[, all_variables]

# Compute correlation matrix and p-values
cor_matrix <- rcorr(as.matrix(all_variables_df2), type = "pearson")$r
cor_matrix[upper.tri(cor_matrix)] <- NA
p_matrix <- rcorr(as.matrix(all_variables_df2), type = "pearson")$P
p_matrix[is.na(p_matrix)] = .0000001
p_matrix[upper.tri(p_matrix)] <- NA

# Melt the matrices for ggplot
melted_cor <- melt(cor_matrix, na.rm = T)
melted_p = melt(p_matrix, na.rm = T)

# Combine correlation and p-value information
melted_cor$p = melted_p$value
melted_cor$psig = ""
melted_cor$psig[melted_cor$p < .05] = "*"
melted_cor$psig[melted_cor$p < .01] = "**"
melted_cor$psig[melted_cor$p < .001] = "***"
melted_cor$hover_text = paste0("Variable 1: ", melted_cor$Var1, 
                               "<br>Variable 2: ", melted_cor$Var2, 
                               "<br>Correlation: ", round(melted_cor$value, 2), 
                               "<br>P-value: ", round(melted_cor$p, 4))

# Create a ggplot heatmap without text labels
all_corr <- ggplot(melted_cor, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value, text = hover_text)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "purple", mid = "white", high = "orange", 
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), space = "Lab",
                       name = "Correlation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Remove x axis labels
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),  # Remove y axis labels
        axis.title = element_blank(),  # Remove axis titles
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +  # Remove axis ticks
  labs(caption = "<.05 = *, <.01 = **, <.001 = ***") +
  ggtitle("Correlation Matrix all variables")

# Convert the ggplot to an interactive plotly plot
interactive_corr <- ggplotly(all_corr, tooltip = "text")

# Show the interactive plot
interactive_corr

```

## Gahlot Plot

To have a ready to go publishable corr plot, I created the code below. I've used portions of this for many presentations and in papers with excellent feedback and very little effort on my end. 
 
```{r gahlot plot, fig.width=15,fig.height=15}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(Hmisc)

QOL_variables <- c("Global", "IADL",  "Leisure", "Fitness", "Social", "Anger", "Anxiety", "Depression", "Grief", "Resilience", "SelfEsteem", "Stigma", "TraitResilience", "PositiveAffect", "Communication", "GeneralCognition", "ExecFuncQOL", "UpperExtremity", "Fatigue", "Mobility", "Headache", "Pain")

# Ensure selected variables are in the dataframe
QOL_variables <- intersect(QOL_variables, colnames(df2))

# Extract relevant data
QOL_df2 <- df2[, QOL_variables]

# Calculate correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- rcorr(as.matrix(QOL_df2), type = "spearman")$r
cor_matrix[upper.tri(cor_matrix)] <- NA
p_matrix <- rcorr(as.matrix(QOL_df2), type = "spearman")$P
p_matrix[is.na(p_matrix)] <- .0000001
p_matrix[upper.tri(p_matrix)] <- NA

# Melt the correlation matrix for ggplot
melted_cor <- melt(cor_matrix, na.rm = TRUE)
melted_p <- melt(p_matrix, na.rm = TRUE)

melted_cor$p <- melted_p$value
melted_cor$psig <- ""
melted_cor$psig[melted_cor$p < .05] <- "*"
melted_cor$psig[melted_cor$p < .01] <- "**"
melted_cor$psig[melted_cor$p < .001] <- "***"

# Create a heatmap using ggplot2
p <- ggplot(melted_cor, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(value, 2)), vjust = 1, size = 6, family = "Times New Roman") +  # Adjust size and font
  geom_text(aes(label = psig), vjust = .25, size = 6, family = "Times New Roman") +  # Adjust size and font
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "purple", mid = "white", high = "orange", 
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), space = "Lab",
                       name = "Correlation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 20, family = "Times New Roman"),  # Adjust size and font
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 20, family = "Times New Roman"),  # Adjust size and font
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, family = "Times New Roman"),
        axis.ticks = element_line(linewidth = 1), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, family = "Times New Roman"),  # Add title font
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 14, family = "Times New Roman")) +  # Add caption font
  labs(caption = "<.05 = *, <.01 = **, <.001 = ***") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Correlation Matrix Personal Protective Factors with ACS Variables")


#Show plot
print(p)
```
 
If it's not working out for you and feeling way too crunched, look at your code chunk set up: {r gahlot plot, fig.width=15,fig.height=15} and play with the fig.width and fig.height and that should solve your problems! 

To save this as a png at 300 dpi to your working directory, see code below:


```{r save gahlot plot}
ggsave("correlation_matrix_plot.png", plot = p, width = 15, height = 15, dpi = 300)

#play with width and height to get the proportions right
```

With a little screen shot and quick edits in any editing software (I use keynote), it can look like this:

# Interactive plots

Interactive plots are a great way to be truly transparent with your data and allow others to explore it. Embedding interactive charts in your code will help your collaborators and can even be transformed into an interactive website. Below, I'll review a few different types of interactive plots. Two really wonderful websites for interactive data visualization are below: 

https://r-graph-gallery.com/interactive-charts.html

https://www.data-to-viz.com

There are a few packages that work for interactive plots. I prefer plotly as there seems to be less drama with it compared to some others.

## Scatter Plots

A scatter plot is a type of data visualization that displays the relationship between two continuous variables. Each point on the plot represents an observation, with its position determined by the values of the two variables being compared. Scatter plots are useful for identifying patterns, trends, and correlations between variables, as well as spotting outliers.

Below we are looking at the relationship between Apathy and Social Re-engagement after TBI

```{r}
interactive_scatter <- plot_ly(
  data = df_demo,
  x = ~frsbe_apathy, #x axis variable
  y = ~acss_retain, #y-axis variable
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'markers',
  text = ~paste("Apathy Score: ", frsbe_apathy, "<br>Social Re-engagement: ", acss_retain, "<br>record_id: ", record_id), #This is what will show when you hover over a plot. You can add your record_id or Participant id variable so when you hover over an outlier, you can identify it quickly
  hoverinfo = 'text'
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Relationship between Apathy and Social Re-engagement after TBI",
    xaxis = list(title = 'Apathy Score'),
    yaxis = list(title = 'Social Re-engagement')
)

# Make the plot interactive with plotly
ggplotly(interactive_scatter, tooltip = "text")

```

Below is this same scatter plot, but divided by severity of injury. I might do this if I thought the relationships looked different with moderate vs severe injuries. 

```{r interactive scatterplot}
library(ggplot2)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(plotly)

# Create the interactive scatter plot
interactive_scatter <- df_demo %>%
  mutate(text = paste("Apathy Score: ", frsbe_apathy, "\nSocial Re-engagement: ", acss_retain)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = frsbe_apathy, y = acss_retain, text = text)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = severity), alpha = 0.6) +  # Color points based on severity
  ggtitle("Relationship between Apathy and Social Re-engagement after TBI") +
  theme_ipsum() +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 12)
  ) +
  ylab('Social Re-engagement') +
  xlab('Apathy Score')

# Make the plot interactive with plotly
ggplotly(interactive_scatter, tooltip = "text")

```

## Bubble plot

A bubble plot is a scatterplot where a third dimension is added: the value of an additional numeric variable is represented through the size of the dots.You need 3 numerical variables as input: one is represented by the X axis, one by the Y axis, and one by the dot size.

In this example, I'm going to add age to the above scatter plot as my third variable.

```{r more libraries, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(viridis)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggrepel)
library(plotly)
```

```{r bubble plot, fig.width=10,fig.height=7}
interactive_bubble <- plot_ly(
  data = df2,
  x = ~Apathy, #variable 1
  y = ~Social, #variable 2
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'markers',
  color = ~Age,
  size = ~Age,
   # Adjust the size and color based on age (or any other variable or can delete if you don't want those options
  text = ~paste("Apathy Score: ", Apathy, "<br>Social Re-engagement: ", Social, "<br>Age: ", Age), #you can customize any information you want to show up when you hover : <br> breaks to a new line
  hoverinfo = 'text',
  marker = list(sizemode = 'diameter', opacity = 0.7, line = list(width = 1))  # Customize size behavior
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Relationship between Apathy and Social Re-engagement after TBI",
    xaxis = list(title = 'Apathy Score'),
    yaxis = list(title = 'Social Re-engagement')
)
#Make it interactive
ggplotly(interactive_bubble, tooltip = "text")
```

In this example, I'm going to look at the relationship between grief and depression with the dot size related the person's current engagement in activities and the color for age. This is an example of adding a fourth element. 

```{r bubble, fig.width=10,fig.height=7}

interactive_bubble4 <- plot_ly(
  data = df2,
  x = ~Grief, #variable 1
  y = ~Depression, #variable 2
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'markers',
  color = ~Age,
  size = ~Global,
   # Adjust the size and color based on age (or any other variable or can delete if you don't want those options
  text = ~paste("Grief Score: ", Grief, "<br>Depression Score: ", Depression, "<br>Age: ", Age, "<br>Global", Global), #you can customize any information you want to show up when you hover : <br> breaks to a new line
  hoverinfo = 'text',
  marker = list(sizemode = 'diameter', opacity = 0.7, line = list(width = 1))  # Customize size behavior
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Relationship between Apathy and Social Re-engagement after TBI",
    xaxis = list(title = 'Apathy Score'),
    yaxis = list(title = 'Social Re-engagement')
)
#Make it interactive
ggplotly(interactive_bubble4, tooltip = "text")

```


## Interactive Heatmaps

```{r, results='hide'}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(viridis)
library(heatmaply)
library(plotly)
# d3heatmap is not on CRAN yet, but can be found here: https://github.com/talgalili/d3heatmap
#To load this follow these steps
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
#install_github("talgalili/d3heatmap")
library(d3heatmap)
```
For the heatmaps, we're going to leave the data set we've been working with to use different types of data with the information provided in each example

```{r interactive heatmap, fig.width=10,fig.height=10}

# Details and variations can be found here: https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/heatmap.html

# Load data
data <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/multivariate.csv", header = T, sep = ";")
colnames(data) <- gsub("\\.", " ", colnames(data))

# Select a few country
data <- data %>%
  filter(Country %in% c("France", "Sweden", "Italy", "Spain", "England", "Portugal", "Greece", "Peru", "Chile", "Brazil", "Argentina", "Bolivia", "Venezuela", "Australia", "New Zealand", "Fiji", "China", "India", "Thailand", "Afghanistan", "Bangladesh", "United States of America", "Canada", "Burundi", "Angola", "Kenya", "Togo")) %>%
  arrange(Country) %>%
  mutate(Country = factor(Country, Country))

# Matrix format (Remove unnecessary columns)
mat <- data
rownames(mat) <- mat[,1]
mat <- mat %>% dplyr::select(-Country, -Group, -Continent)
mat <- as.matrix(mat)

# Interactive heatmap using heatmaply
p <- heatmaply(mat,
               dendrogram = "none",
               xlab = "", 
               ylab = "",
               main = "",
               scale = "column",
               margins = c(60,100,40,20),
               grid_color = "white",
               grid_width = 0.00001,
               titleX = FALSE,
               hide_colorbar = TRUE,
               branches_lwd = 0.1,
               label_names = c("Country", "Feature:", "Value"),
               fontsize_row = 5, 
               fontsize_col = 5,
               labCol = colnames(mat),
               labRow = rownames(mat),
               heatmap_layers = theme(axis.line = element_blank())
)

# Display the heatmap
p
```


## Stacked Plots
An interactive stacked plot for longitudinal data is particularly useful because it allows us to visualize changes over time in a clear, dynamic way. 

In this example, we'll understand why I have so many friends my age with the name Amanda


```{r names stacked, fig.width=10,fig.height=7}
# Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(babynames) #just for the data for analysis, not needed for the code
library(viridis)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(plotly)

# Load dataset from github
data <- babynames %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Ashley", "Amanda", "Jessica", "Patricia", "Linda", "Deborah", "Dorothy", "Betty", "Helen")) %>%
  filter(sex == "F")

# Stacked Plot
names <- data %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x=year, y=n, fill=name, text=name)) +
    geom_area( ) +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    theme(legend.position="none") +
    ggtitle("Popularity of American names in the previous 30 years") +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(legend.position="none")

# Turn it interactive
names <- ggplotly(names, tooltip="text")
names

```

# Sharing Across Platforms

There are several ways to share your tables interactive plots and charts with others. 

## 1. Knitting to HTML
One advantage of using an R Notebook is the ability to knit your content into an HTML file. This file can then be shared directly as a local file or uploaded to the web, such as on GitHub, making it easily accessible to others.

Additionally, knitting your document will help identify any bugs or issues with your document as a whole that you might have missed when working in sections or specific chunks. 

Once you select "Knit" to HTML, your html file will save to your working directory. You can set up your R Notebook to default knit to HTML as well with output: html at the start of your document.

**PRO TIPS**

*Knitting works a little differently than running code.* And code that seems to work in R Studio may not work when you knit, so you may need to trouble shoot a bit. 

*Additionally, you can also customize what is shown and what is not.* For example, when I share my work with a colleague who does not know R, I often 'hide' the code to make it cleaner and easier to follow.

*Knitting to PDF* A PDF does not allow you to use the interactive plots effectively. I recommend only knitting to html for interactive plots and data visualization.

You can find out more about how to customize your output here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html

## 2. Commit to Git

Once you have an html file, you can host it as a website in a variety of different ways. One includes using GitHub, which (depending on your workflow) may allow for more reproducibility and transparency with your work. 

There are many tutorials and videos on how to host a static website through GitHub. For me, because I'm working in R Studio anyway, I create a new version control project and link that to the corresponding repository on GitHub. When I'm done writing the script, I commit to git (or push changes when I make them) and include the html knitted file in with the .rmd file. 

To then turn this pushed html file into a website, you add the name of the file.html onto the link and it should work.

*For example my repository on GitHub is:  https://amandagahlot.github.io/ReproRehab_DataVis/
And so I added DataVis.html to go to the website: https://amandagahlot.github.io/ReproRehab_DataVis/DataVis.html *

## 3. Saving widgets
Saving interactive html widgets to embed them in other platforms and documents can be finicky. 

Step 1: Required packages
```{r}
#install.packages("htmlwidgets")
library(htmlwidgets)
library(plotly)
```

Step 2: Save your plot

```{r}
saveWidget(interactive_bubble, "interactive_plot.html", selfcontained = TRUE)
```

## 4. Sharing in Presentation

This is tricky. Powerpoint, Keynote, and Google Slides have eliminated the add ons that once allowed us to embed html files into the presentation Work arounds (like embedding in Polls Everywhere or Menti) are not often successful. But fear not. Where there is a will there is a way. 

To allow an audience to engage with your data, you can QR code your website (see 2: Commit to Git) and they can go through your entire knitted file. OR, you can share 1 interactive plot with them (my recommendation)

To do this:

1. Save specific interactive plot as an html (see 3. Saving Widgets)

2. Push that widget html file to your Git respository

3. Create your website based on that new widget. *In my example, this would be: https://amandagahlot.github.io/ReproRehab_DataVis/interactive_plot.html *

4. Create a static QR code for that website

# Final Thoughts

## R Packages

- R is finicky when it comes to packages. Often packages that are loaded early are masked by packages loaded late. If you had a code that *was* working, but now is not-- check your packages. For me, d3heatmap package maskedmy print() function and I had to "turn off" d3heatmap to get my code to work. This is another reason to have a separate environment for your data visualizations

## Time Series

- There are a lot of time series visuals that I didn't review as I have worked more in cross sectional data. Explore data-to-viz.com to check them out.

## Python

Seaborn library (for me) is far superior with creating side by side visuals for looking at relationships. Check it out... Start a new Google Colab and enter the code below:

import seaborn as sns
df = sns.load_dataset('iris')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
Basic correlogram
>sns_plot = sns.pairplot(df)
sns_plot.savefig("IMG/correlogram1.png")

Or make it a regression
>sns_plot = sns.pairplot(df, kind="reg")
sns_plot.savefig("IMG/correlogram2.png")

Each of the websites included review Python code as well for interactive plots!
